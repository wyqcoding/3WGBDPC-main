The source code for A Robust Three-Way Density Peaks Clustering Based on Granular-Ball Structure. The algorithm is implemented in Python, which is 3WGBDPC.py. After constructing the decision graph, please manually select centers in the plot.
We also upload some synthetic datasets. Please note that drawing the clustering results may take a little longer time.
